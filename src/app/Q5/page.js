    <p>Imagine that the customer from Question 4 responds with the following email.
    “I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just
    can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for
    me instead of asking me questions.”
    Write a reply to the customer addressing the concerns raised.
    
    "I'm sorry to hear this. I know how frustrating that can be. Let's hope on a quick call, or can you share with me the code you are trying and I can help troubleshoot it?</p>)
